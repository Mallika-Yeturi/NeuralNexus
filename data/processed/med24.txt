Dan JurafskyHow to find the Min Edit Distance?•Searching for a path (sequence of edits) from the start string to the final string:•Initial state: the word we’re transforming•Operators: insert, delete, substitute•Goal state:  the word we’re trying to get to•Path cost: what we want to minimize: the number of edits8

## Page 9

Dan JurafskyMinimum Edit as Search•But the space of all edit sequences is huge!•We can’t afford to navigate naïvely•Lots of distinct paths wind up at the same state.•We don’t have to keep track of all of them•Just the shortest path to each of those revisted states.9

Dan JurafskyDefining Min Edit Distance•For two strings•X of length n •Y of length m•We define D(i,j)•the edit distance between X[1..i] and Y[1..j] •i.e., the first i characters of X and the first j characters of Y•The edit distance between X and Y is thus D(n,m)

Dan JurafskyComputing alignments•Edit distance isn’t sufficient•We often need to align each character of the two strings to each other•We do this by keeping a “backtrace”•Every time we enter a cell, remember where we came from•When we reach the end, •Trace back the path from the upper right corner to read off the alignment

Dan JurafskyWhere did the name, dynamic programming, come from? …The 1950s were not good years for mathematical research. [the] Secretary of Defense …had a pathological fear and hatred of the word, research… I decided therefore to use the word, “programming”. I wanted to get across the idea that this was dynamic, this was multistage… I thought, let’s … take a word that has an absolutely precise meaning, namely dynamic… it’s impossible to use the word, dynamic, in a pejorative sense. Try thinking of some combination that will possibly give it a pejorative meaning. It’s impossible. Thus, I thought dynamic programming was a good name. It was something not even a Congressman could object to.”    Richard Bellman, “Eye of the Hurricane: an autobiography” 1984.
