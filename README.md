## 🌟 What is NeuralNexus?

NeuralNexus transforms the dense academic knowledge from Jurafsky & Martin's "Speech & Language Processing" textbook into an interactive, conversational experience. It's like having a personal NLP tutor available 24/7 who knows exactly which page to turn to for your questions.

## ✨ Key Features

- **📚 Source-Grounded Answers**: Every response is anchored in the textbook with precise citations
- **💬 Conversation Memory**: Ask follow-up questions naturally, just like talking to a professor
- **🔍 Source Transparency**: See exactly which sections of the textbook informed each answer
- **🧩 Complex Concept Navigation**: Understand challenging NLP concepts through clear, structured explanations
- **📊 Educational Clarity**: 4.6/5 clarity rating from student evaluations

## 🛠️ Under the Hood

NeuralNexus employs a sophisticated RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) architecture:
Text Processing → Embedding Store → Retrieval Engine → LLM + Prompt → User Interface
- **🔄 Text Processing**: Custom processors extract and clean content from both HTML and PDF formats
- **🧮 Embedding Store**: 1.5k-dimensional vectors in ChromaDB with FAISS backend
- **🔎 Retrieval Engine**: Cosine similarity search with optimized parameters (k=6)
- **🧠 LLM Integration**: GPT-4o with specialized educational prompting (T=0.3)
- **👤 User Experience**: Clean, intuitive Gradio interface with markdown support

## 📊 Impressive Results

| Metric | Value | Comparison to Baseline |
